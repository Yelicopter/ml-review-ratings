Also if yiu dont want that flour-y taste make sure when you add it you stir constantly and cook for a 1-2 minutes as this will &amp;quot;cook&amp;quot; the flavor out and my other tip before adding flour to the cream mix it with a splash of hot water as this will make a paste that blend into the cream much easier and will prevent clumping</td>\n",

       "1401765  Good base recipe for someone to start with. I quadruple the recipe and use heavy cream. Also if yiu dont want that flour-y taste make sure when you add it you stir constantly and cook for a 1-2 minutes as this will &quot;cook&quot; the flavor out and my other tip before adding flour to the cream mix it with a splash of hot water as this will make a paste that blend into the cream much easier and will prevent clumping   \n",

The icing does have a good flavor and does get a bit thicker if you put it in the refrigerator for awhile....I will not make this one again.........:(  I am quite a good baker but this just didn&#039;t do it for me.

       "79996  Great Recipe. I'm living in a guest house in Kenya with limited resources. I found a nice brie and can make soup out of anything, but no crackers available until I tried this simple treat. The entire house adored the result. I had to cut the recipe to 1/4 because I had no bowl and I used a beer bottle for a roller, but the recipe is very forgiving.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dough is moist, so use enough flour to hold it together and not stick when you roll it thin.  For more flavor, add more salt to the dough.  It's not for low sodium dieters anyway!   \n",
